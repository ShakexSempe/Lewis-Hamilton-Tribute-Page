                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton">Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton
                </a>is widely regarded as one of the greatest drivers in the history of Formula One, and considered by
                some (including the author of this page) to be the greatest of all time. He won his first
                World Drivers' Championship with <a target="_blank"

                in 2013, with whom he has won a further five titles.</br>

                <br>The most successful drivers in the history of the sport, Hamilton's seven World Championship titles
                is an all-time record (tied with <a target="_blank"

                Hamilton holds the record for the <span> most race wins in Formula One history</span>. Michael

            <h2>Title Wins:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li> <span> 2008</span> <br>Hamilton won his first title in dramatic fashion; on the last corner of
                    the last lap in the last race of the season, becoming the then-youngest Formula One World
                    Champion in history as he denied race-winner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Massa"
                        target="_blank">Felipe Massa</a> the title
                    by one point.</li>

                <li> <span>2014</span> <br>Changes to regulations ahead of the 2014 season, which mandated the use
                    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_engines" target="_blank">turbo-hybrid
                        engines</a> , contributed to the start of a highly successful era for Hamilton as he found
                    himself in the most dominant car on the grid. That year saw Mercedes win 16 of the 19 races that
                    season, 11 of those secured by Hamilton as he prevailed in a season-long duel for the title
                    against teammate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Rosberg" target="_blank">Nico
                        Rosberg</a>. </li>
                <li> <span>2015</span> <br>Hamilton dominated the 2015 season, winning ten races finishing on the
                    podium a record seventeen times as he matched his hero <a id="tribute-link" target="_blank"
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrton_Senna">Ayrton Senna
                    </a> with three World Championships titles. </li>
                <li> <span> 2017</span> <br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari"
                        target="_blank">Scuderia Ferrari</a> and their four World Champion <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> became Hamilton's
                    closest rival as the pair exchanged the championship lead throughout 2017 in a tense title
                    fight. Hamilton registered 11 pole positions that season as he took the record for the all-time
                    most pole positions, and his consistency (finishing every race in the points), as well as a lack
                    of a serious challenge from his new teammate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas"
                        target="_blank">Valtteri Bottas</a>,
                    saw him record nine race victories and secure his fourth World Drivers' title as he overturned a
                    points deficit to Vettel in the first half of the season, ultimately wrapping the title up in
                    Mexico with two races to spare. </li>
                <li> <span>2018</span> <br>The 2018 season was the first time that two four-time World Champions,
                    Hamilton and Vettel, would be competing for a fifth title and was billed as the Fight for Five
                    by journalists and fans. As with the season before, Ferrari and Vettel appeared to have the
                    upper hand for much of the season, topping the standings until the half-way point. However,
                    Vettel's season unravelled with a number of driver and mechanical errors, while Hamilton's run
                    of six wins in seven in the latter half of the season saw Hamilton clinch the title in Mexico
                    for a second year running as he set a new record for the most points scored in a season (408)
                </li>
                <li><span> 2019</span> <br>Having signed a contract with Mercedes that lasts until 2020, it was
                    confirmed Hamilton would defend his title in 2019. Hamilton led the drivers' standings for the
                    majority of the season, fending off title challenges from team-mate Bottas, the <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing_RB15" target="_blank">Honda-powered Red

                        Verstappen</a> and Ferrari's recently promoted <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc" target="_blank">Charles Leclerc</a>, to
                    clinch his sixth drivers' crown at the 2019 United States Grand Prix with two races remaining.
                </li>
                <li> <span> 2020</span> <br>
                    At the Portuguese Grand Prix, Hamilton took his 92nd Formula One win, breaking the record previously
                    held by Michael Schumacher. His victory in Turkey saw him seal his seventh drivers' title, equalling
                    Schumacher's record of seven World Championship titles.
