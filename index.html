                <h2>Title Wins:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li> <span> 2008</span> <br>Hamilton won his first title in dramatic fashion; on the last corner of
                        the last lap in the last race of the season, becoming the then-youngest Formula One World
                        Champion in history as he denied race-winner <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Massa" target="_blank">Felipe Massa</a> the title
                        by one point.</li>

                    <li> <span>2014</span> <br>Changes to regulations ahead of the 2014 season, which mandated the use
                        of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_engines" target="_blank">turbo-hybrid
                            engines</a> , contributed to the start of a highly successful era for Hamilton as he found
                        himself in the most dominant car on the grid. That year saw Mercedes win 16 of the 19 races that
                        season, 11 of those secured by Hamilton as he prevailed in a season-long duel for the title
                        against teammate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Rosberg" target="_blank">Nico
                            Rosberg</a>. </li>
                    <li> <span>2015</span> <br>Hamilton dominated the 2015 season, winning ten races finishing on the
                        podium a record seventeen times as he matched his hero <a id="tribute-link" target="_blank"

                        </a> with three World Championships titles. </li>

                        closest rival as the pair exchanged the championship lead throughout 2017 in a tense title
                        fight. Hamilton registered 11 pole positions that season as he took the record for the all-time
                        most pole positions, and his consistency (finishing every race in the points), as well as a lack
                        of a serious challenge from his new teammate <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas" target="_blank">Valtteri Bottas</a>,
                        saw him record nine race victories and secure his fourth World Drivers' title as he overturned a
                        points deficit to Vettel in the first half of the season, ultimately wrapping the title up in
                        Mexico with two races to spare. </li>
                    <li> <span>2018</span> <br>The 2018 season was the first time that two four-time World Champions,
                        Hamilton and Vettel, would be competing for a fifth title and was billed as the Fight for Five
                        by journalists and fans. As with the season before, Ferrari and Vettel appeared to have the
                        upper hand for much of the season, topping the standings until the half-way point. However,
                        Vettel's season unravelled with a number of driver and mechanical errors, while Hamilton's run
                        of six wins in seven in the latter half of the season saw Hamilton clinch the title in Mexico
                        for a second year running as he set a new record for the most points scored in a season (408)
                    </li>

                        confirmed Hamilton would defend his title in 2019. Hamilton led the drivers' standings for the
                        majority of the season, fending off title challenges from team-mate Bottas, the <a
